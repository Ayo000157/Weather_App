🌤️ Weather App (Flask + OpenWeather API)
This is a Weather Web App built using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, and the OpenWeather API.
It allows users to search for any city and get real-time weather updates, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description all displayed on a simple, responsive interface.

🚀 Project Overview
The Weather App is a full-stack mini-project that combines frontend and backend technologies.
Users can input a city name, and the app connects to the OpenWeather API to fetch live weather data and display it neatly in the browser.

	•	🌡️ Displays temperature, humidity, and conditions
	•	💨 Shows wind speed and weather description
	•	⚡ Built with Flask backend and HTML/CSS frontend
	•	🧠 Handles errors such as “City Not Found” gracefully

🛠️ Tech Stack
